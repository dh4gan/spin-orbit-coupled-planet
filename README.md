This code (written in C++) calculates the surface flux received by a planet in orbit of a star
with a user defined set of orbital elements and spin period.  The input parameters are read from

spinorbit_coupled_planet.params

Outputs can be plotted using the python scripts in 
(requires numpy, matplotlib)
